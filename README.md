Probabilistic Roadmap Algorithms are used in robotics to find a collision-free path between a start point and an end point in a map with obstacles. After a collision-free path has been found, a post-processing algorithm like the Path Shortcutting algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between the start point and the destination from the sampled points.
